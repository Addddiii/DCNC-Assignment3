Chapter 1 Assessment – general processes
Design of assessment
1.1. Exams and assessment tasks must be materially different from any assessment task in the course in previous teaching periods across locations (over a two-year period) unless restricted by requirements for specific competencies for reasons of accreditation or safety.
1.2. In any 12 credit point course, the total number of assessment tasks should not exceed 4, and in any 24 credit point course, the total number of assessment tasks should not exceed 6 except where progressive assessment involves more regular submission of contributions to a single assessment piece.
1.3. The proportion of multiple choice answer assessments should not exceed 20% of the weighting of assessment tasks towards the final course grade.
1.4. For higher education programs, the weighting of an individual piece of assessment within a course will be no greater than 50% of the total marks except where the course is a research, studio-based, capstone or WIL component of the program.
Assessment information in course guides
1.7. See the course guides section of the program and course processes for: assessment information that must be provided in course guides conditions under which assessment in a course can be changed after the course offering has started.
Assessment rubrics
1.8. The instructions for each assessment must provide students with clear and detailed advice of the criteria by which their performance will be assessed.

Section 6 - Definitions
Academic misconduct: Conduct by a student that is intended, or likely to have the effect of obtaining, for that student or any other person, an advantage in the performance of assessment by unauthorised, dishonest, unethical or unfair means whether or not the advantage was obtained. See also the Student Conduct Policy.
Collusion: is unauthorised collaboration. Occurs where more than one student contributes to an assessment task that is submitted as the work of an individual student where the collaboration is not permitted for the assessment task. Collusion may also occur in group work where unauthorised collaboration occurs between groups.
Contract cheating: is the use of outsourced material for the purpose of submission by a student for assessment. The person submitting the work is being dishonest by representing it as their own.
Copying: occurs when paragraphs, sentences, a single sentence or significant parts of a sentence, or the key points or structure of another person's work have been used in an assessment without acknowledging the source.
Fabrication: occurs when a student claims to have carried out tests, experiments, research or observations that have not taken place.
Falsification: involves the misrepresentation of research data, source material or results, or the presentation of results that are not supported by the evidence.
Impersonation: involves the completion and submission of an assessment task by another person that dishonestly misrepresents themselves as the person to whom the assessment task was assigned.
Plagiarism: the presentation of the work, idea or creation of another person as though it is one's own.
